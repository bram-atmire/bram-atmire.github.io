# Bootstrap dropdown with list instead of buttons

I was struggling with the styling because I was using buttons and I didn't want the dropdown to look like buttons.
The [nbgDropdown](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/dropdown/examples) only lists an example based on buttons.
Stackoverflow showed me the way with [Bootstrap Menu list item dropdown not button](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38487604/bootstrap-menu-list-item-dropdown-not-button?rq=1).

Sadly, this is not working out great and the actual language switching is now broken and I still haven't figured out to turn the color into grey instead of the blue it has now.

# Day 50 Plan

Figure out the final styling for the lang dropdown

# September sustainability challenge - Completed

[The money has been wired](https://my.charitywater.org/bram-luyten/code-for-water) and I'm closing the books on the September sustainability challenge where I was sponsored for every successful day and where I would punish myself for every missed day.

# New sustainability challenge - Finish before Christmas

With today being day 43, there are 57 days of coding left. Setting the goal to get there before Dec 25th gives me a little more flexibility while still requiring a high frequency.

In terms of positive motivator, I'm currently thinking along the lines of a big reward at the end, while at the same time still wondering about something more incremental for Oct/Nov, or to have a self-punishment system in here as well.
