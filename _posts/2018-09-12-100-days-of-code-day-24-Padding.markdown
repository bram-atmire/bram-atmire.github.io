Stackoverflow to the rescue once again to clarify the [difference between CSS height 100% and height auto](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15943009/difference-between-css-height-100-vs-height-auto).

Shipped the update!

# Future Days - other ideas

1. Switch to a different project: start working on DSpace 7 Angular
2. Setup IDEA so I can start editing these blogposts from there, instead of in a text editor
3. Developer productivity: Get my IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts in order (CMD+1, CMD+/, ...)

# Future Days - Atmire.com work

Investigate and work on search engine optimization (SEO) for the main atmire.com website.

# Future Days - Learning just for learning

* CSS: Go through the fabulous [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)

# Sustainability - Raising the stakes - Looking for sponsors

I have raised the stakes by
* giving €100 to Charity:Water for every day I miss.
* asking people to sponsor me and to give an amount to a charity for each day I successfully complete

This way, every day would be a win. These are the rules that I'll apply:

1. I can anticipate or fix a lost day by doing an hour extra the day before, or an hour extra the day after. In theory this means I can maximally compensate a streak of 2 missed days. 
2. Goal is to have a steady frequency, so I can't just do 8h on a sunday to get myself off the hook for the next 7 days.
3. Sponsor commitments are fully voluntarily: any sponsor can back out at any time.
4. My commitment is fully voluntarily: if I want to change the rules or back out, I can at any time.

This month, these are already days that will be very tough:
* Sep 14,15,16,17 - Abroad for a wedding
* Sep 27,28 - Supernova conference Antwerp

So that's already a lot of exposure to potentially missed days. 

I will raise the stakes this way and gather money for Charity:Water. Let me know if you want to sponsor me and for how much per completed day in September. September 1st is the first successfully completed day.

# September tracking

Will only log the failed days here. No failed days so far.

# Thanks to the following sponsors!

1. Jan & Hilde: €2 per successful day (Yes, these are my parents)
