# CSS down button

The color of the circular button with the arrows now matches the lighter color of the text in sections other than the page intro.

# Contrast

Found that there's quite a lot of content out there, specifically on contrast between fonts and background colors, like [Color Contrast for Better Readability](https://www.viget.com/articles/color-contrast/).

After the intro, the section is just white with light blue. The white feels too plain and is also light, in comparison with the background image of the intro section.

When turning it into a darker color, I noticed there are padding issues on the left and the bottom, with sections of white still popping up.

# Day 23 Plan

* CSS: resolve padding issues and make the background of the "basic principles" section darker again.
* Investigate empty rows with TODO message showing up in the list of recently scanned repos

# Future days - Analyzer.atmire.com work

* Change String based implementation of error message handling with types and objects, according to Antoine Snyers recent Atmire DevTalk.
* Change string based implementation of the different browse styles to an object, according to Antoine Snyers recent Atmire DevTalk
* Add recently verified items to the homepage.
* Optimize my hideous methods for getItemcount and getRepoCount.
* Re-test the check if we return the right repository to a user who tries to add a new one
* Updating a repository: touch/change the base URL or not?
* Batch ingest: switch to newer add repository methods.
* WCAG testing against the start page to ensure it's accessible for people who rely on assistive tools.
* Investigate empty rows with TODO message showing up in the list of recently scanned repos

# Future Days - other ideas

1. Switch to a different project: start working on DSpace 7 Angular
2. Setup IDEA so I can start editing these blogposts from there, instead of in a text editor
3. Developer productivity: Get my IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts in order (CMD+1, CMD+/, ...)

# Future Days - Atmire.com work

Investigate and work on search engine optimization (SEO) for the main atmire.com website.

# Sustainability - Raising the stakes - Looking for sponsors

I have raised the stakes by
* giving €100 to Charity:Water for every day I miss.
* asking people to sponsor me and to give an amount to a charity for each day I successfully complete

This way, every day would be a win. These are the rules that I'll apply:

1. I can anticipate or fix a lost day by doing an hour extra the day before, or an hour extra the day after. In theory this means I can maximally compensate a streak of 2 missed days. 
2. Goal is to have a steady frequency, so I can't just do 8h on a sunday to get myself off the hook for the next 7 days.
3. Sponsor commitments are fully voluntarily: any sponsor can back out at any time.
4. My commitment is fully voluntarily: if I want to change the rules or back out, I can at any time.

This month, these are already days that will be very tough:
* Sep 14,15,16,17 - Abroad for a wedding
* Sep 27,28 - Supernova conference Antwerp

So that's already a lot of exposure to potentially missed days. 

I will raise the stakes this way and gather money for Charity:Water. Let me know if you want to sponsor me and for how much per completed day in September. September 1st is the first successfully completed day.

# September tracking

Will only log the failed days here. No failed days so far.

# Thanks to the following sponsors!

1. Jan & Hilde: €2 per successful day (Yes, these are my parents)
