# Apologies

I'm more and more using this blog for random notes of things I don't want to forget, rather than something nice prosaic for a reader other than myself. Not sure if anyone reads this anyway, but feel free to send me comments if you have any.

# ng-book 2 (p1-53 of 668)

RxJs Observables and Redux are not the same, they are two alternative approaches to manage state in client/server applications.

If plain ls list view of files in a directory is too limited, tree can be installed and used to get a tree view of files in a dir from the command line.

Instead of adding a separate template.html file, you could also write the entire template as part of the decorator in the main typescript file for the module. Downside of doing this, is that editors don't do syntax highlighting of these internal strings yet.

The use of backticks are new in ES6 and allow you to write multi-line strings.

You put the *ngFor directive in the element that you want to repeat, so in a list, on the list item entry itself, not on the entire list.

You have to declare components in a NgModule before you can use them in your templates.

# Day 41 Plan

Figure out how I can resolve a problem with two git repositories in different subfolders, that are inadvertedly configured as git submodules, so I can push exercises for the ng-book to my Github repo

Continue on p53 of [ng-book 2](https://www.ng-book.com/2/)

* Updating a repository: touch/change the base URL or not?
* Batch ingest: switch to newer add repository methods.
* WCAG testing against the start page to ensure it's accessible for people who rely on assistive tools.
* Transition from plain CSS to SASS to make it prettier and learn about SASS at the same time
* Instead of the 5 minute cron job, look into a gitlab webhook that executes the update script on prod whever something is committed to master.

# Sustainability - Raising the stakes - Looking for sponsors (unchanged)

I have raised the stakes by
* giving €100 to Charity:Water for every day I miss.
* asking people to sponsor me and to give an amount to a charity for each day I successfully complete

This way, every day would be a win. These are the rules that I'll apply:

1. I can anticipate or fix a lost day by doing an hour extra the day before, or an hour extra the day after. In theory this means I can maximally compensate a streak of 2 missed days. 
2. Goal is to have a steady frequency, so I can't just do 8h on a sunday to get myself off the hook for the next 7 days.
3. Sponsor commitments are fully voluntarily: any sponsor can back out at any time.
4. My commitment is fully voluntarily: if I want to change the rules or back out, I can at any time.

This month, these are already days that will be very tough:
* Sep 27,28 - Supernova conference Antwerp

So that's already a lot of exposure to potentially missed days. 

I will raise the stakes this way and gather money for Charity:Water. Let me know if you want to sponsor me and for how much per completed day in September. September 1st is the first successfully completed day.

# September tracking

Will only log the failed days here. No failed days so far.

# Thanks to the following sponsors!

1. Jan & Hilde: €2 per successful day (Yes, these are my parents)
