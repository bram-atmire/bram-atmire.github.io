# Angular - Tour of heroes pt6 on HTTP

When going through the first steps of toh-pt6 yesterday, my imports for the rxjs library stopped working, very likely right after installing the angular-in-memory-web-api.

IntelliJ suggested to run yarn install again after which it seemed to work again. But the rxjs add already happened in toh-pt5, so I can't understand why it hasn't broken or required the re-run of yarn install then.

This piece of the tutorial has several examples of functional programming styles where functions themselves are being returned as results, for example in the part on [error handling](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6#error-handling). Need to get used to that type of syntax and its implications.

# Day 39 Plan

* Continue with https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6#add-a-new-hero on HTTP

# Future days - DSpace 7 Angular

* Finish angular.io tutorials
* Translate of the standard messages keys in Dutch, to learn how i18n in Angular works
* Build a feature where users can customize their own language tags, straight from the UI, by switching on some kind of "translator" mode, to do these changes at runtime
* UI for exporting their customized messages
* UI for enabling/disabling particular languages

# Future days - Analyzer.atmire.com work

* Change String based implementation of error message handling with types and objects, according to Antoine Snyers recent Atmire DevTalk.
* Change string based implementation of the different browse styles to an object, according to Antoine Snyers recent Atmire DevTalk
* Optimize my hideous methods for getItemcount and getRepoCount.
* Re-test the check if we return the right repository to a user who tries to add a new one
* Updating a repository: touch/change the base URL or not?
* Batch ingest: switch to newer add repository methods.
* WCAG testing against the start page to ensure it's accessible for people who rely on assistive tools.
* Transition from plain CSS to SASS to make it prettier and learn about SASS at the same time
* Instead of the 5 minute cron job, look into a gitlab webhook that executes the update script on prod whever something is committed to master.

# Future Days - Productivity

* Get my IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts for comments in order

# Future days - Jekyll http://bram-atmire.github.io/ site

* Make it prettier

# Future Days - Atmire.com work

Investigate and work on search engine optimization (SEO) for the main atmire.com website.

# Future Days - Learning just for learning

* CSS: Go through the fabulous [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)

# Questioning the purpose

The last days have been particularly hard to get up for the challenge. Today is no difference, knowing that in the evening, I also have committed to attend the first lesson of Polish I recently enrolled for. That's 6pm to 9.30pm after this code challenge and a full day of working.

Doubting my motivation and thinking of making it 50 days instead of 100 days.

# Sustainability - Raising the stakes - Looking for sponsors (unchanged)

I have raised the stakes by
* giving €100 to Charity:Water for every day I miss.
* asking people to sponsor me and to give an amount to a charity for each day I successfully complete

This way, every day would be a win. These are the rules that I'll apply:

1. I can anticipate or fix a lost day by doing an hour extra the day before, or an hour extra the day after. In theory this means I can maximally compensate a streak of 2 missed days. 
2. Goal is to have a steady frequency, so I can't just do 8h on a sunday to get myself off the hook for the next 7 days.
3. Sponsor commitments are fully voluntarily: any sponsor can back out at any time.
4. My commitment is fully voluntarily: if I want to change the rules or back out, I can at any time.

This month, these are already days that will be very tough:
* Sep 27,28 - Supernova conference Antwerp

So that's already a lot of exposure to potentially missed days. 

I will raise the stakes this way and gather money for Charity:Water. Let me know if you want to sponsor me and for how much per completed day in September. September 1st is the first successfully completed day.

# September tracking

Will only log the failed days here. No failed days so far.

# Thanks to the following sponsors!

1. Jan & Hilde: €2 per successful day (Yes, these are my parents)
